# Binance_rekt

Hello and welcome to the new Project :) 


Deployment on server:

1. install git (sudo apt-get install git)
2. install python (sudo apt-get install python)
3. install pip (sudo apt-get install python3-pip)
4. install tmux
5. 'git clone https://github.com/jaNGOB/Binance_rekt.git'
6. pip install  
"""  
websocket  
influx_line_protocol  
pytz

"""  

Just run main.py and it will save the data of all people getting liquidated into QuestDB. 
This happens until you "CTRL+C" out of there.  
Good luck and have fun watching people loose money.
